11ty (Eleventy) is a powerful static site generator that transforms your content into fast, static websites. Let's explore what makes it special.

## Why Choose 11ty?

11ty stands out for several reasons:

### Flexibility
Unlike other static site generators, 11ty doesn't force you into a specific framework or structure. You can use multiple templating engines in the same project.

### Performance
Static sites generated by 11ty are incredibly fast because they're pre-built HTML files served directly to users.

### Developer Experience
11ty provides excellent tooling for local development with hot reloading and fast builds.

## Template Languages

11ty supports many templating languages out of the box:

```html
<!-- Nunjucks -->
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
{% for post in collections.posts %}
  <article>{{ post.data.title }}</article>
{% endfor %}
```

```markdown
<!-- Markdown with frontmatter -->
---
title: My Post
layout: post.njk
---

# This is my content
Content goes here...
```

## Collections and Data

11ty automatically creates collections from your content. For example, all files with the tag "post" become part of the `collections.post` array.

You can also use data files to provide global site data:

```javascript
// _data/site.js
module.exports = {
  title: "My Blog",
  description: "A blog about web development",
  author: "Your Name"
};
```

## Build Process

The 11ty build process involves:

1. **Reading** content files and templates
2. **Processing** template engines (Nunjucks, Markdown, etc.)
3. **Applying** layouts and includes
4. **Generating** static HTML files
5. **Copying** assets to the output directory

## Best Practices

When working with 11ty:

- **Use semantic HTML** for better accessibility
- **Optimize images** before including them
- **Leverage caching** with proper headers
- **Test responsiveness** across devices
- **Validate HTML** output regularly

This combination of flexibility, performance, and developer experience makes 11ty an excellent choice for blogs, documentation sites, and marketing websites.
